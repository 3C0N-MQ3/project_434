In this model, $beta_1$ is estimated to be 0.1249 with a standard error of 0.0335. The confidence interval for $beta_1$ is (0.0592, 0.1906), indicating that the effect of Uber presence ($D_{it}$) on public transit ridership is positive and statistically significant. This suggests that Uber presence alone is associated with an increase in ridership, indicating that Uber complements public transit.

Additionally, $beta_2$ is estimated to be -0.0963 with a standard error of 0.0375. The confidence interval for $beta_2$ is (-0.1698, -0.0229), indicating that the interaction effect of having a population above the median and Uber presence ($P_{it} \times D_{it}$) on public transit ridership is negative and statistically significant. This suggests that in areas with a population above the median, Uber presence is associated with a 10% decrease in ridership compared to areas with below-median populations, indicating that Uber substitutes public transit in more populous areas.
