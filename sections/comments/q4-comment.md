Instead of examining how the effect of Uber differs based on the population, we now account for heterogeneity based on the number of riders using public transit before Uber arrived. We add $F_{it}$, a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the number of rides of the public transit agency is larger than the median number of rides among all public transit agencies in the dataset. Using this model, we estimate a 3.09% decrease in ridership, suggesting that Uber substitutes public transit. Apart from that important difference, the rest of the control variables are similar in both magnitude and sign to those observed in regression 3.
