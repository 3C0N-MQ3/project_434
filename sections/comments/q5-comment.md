We are running a LASSO regression to understand which of the covariates in the dataset are the most relevant predictors of public transit ridership. This model includes \(P_{it}\), a dummy variable that conditions on whether the population is larger than the median population in the dataset. The coefficients for Uber presence (D) and population (P) are both zero, suggesting they do not significantly affect ridership in this context. Employment and vehicle hours appear to be the only significant predictors, both contributing positively to ridership.
