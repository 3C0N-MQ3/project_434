This model includes $F_{it}, a dummy variable that conditions on whether the number of rides of the public transit agency is larger than the median number of rides among all public transit agencies before Uber was introduced. The coefficients for Uber presence (D) and the number of riders before Uber (F) are, again, zero, suggesting they do not significantly affect ridership in this context. As in the previous model, employment and vehicle hours appear to be the only significant predictors, both contributing positively to ridership. 

We observe that in both regressions, the non-zero coefficients are the same and identical in magnitude. Two factors contribute to this observation. Firstly, in both regressions, the penalty parameter calculated by the BCHH is identical. Secondly, despite having different treatments, we identify the same subset of variables as important. These factors also lead to the result that the treatments are disregarded, allowing us to conclude that they are not significant predictors of public transit ridership.
