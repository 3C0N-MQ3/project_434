In this model, $beta_1$ is estimated to be -0.2374 with a standard error of 0.0188. The confidence interval for $beta_1$ is (-0.2743, -0.2006), indicating that the effect of Uber presence ($D_{it}$) on public transit ridership is negative and statistically significant. This suggests that Uber presence alone is associated with a decrease in ridership, indicating that Uber substitutes public transit.

Additionally, $beta_2$ is estimated to be 0.5964 with a standard error of 0.0224. The confidence interval for $beta_2$ is (0.5525, 0.6403), indicating that the interaction effect of having a number of riders above the median and Uber presence ($F_{it} \times D_{it}$) on public transit ridership is positive and statistically significant. This suggests that in areas with a number of riders above the median, Uber presence is associated with a 60% increase in ridership compared to areas with below-median ridership, indicating that Uber complements public transit in areas with higher initial ridership.
