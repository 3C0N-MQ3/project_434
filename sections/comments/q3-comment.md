We expand our analysis to examine how the effect of Uber differs based on the population of the MSA. We add $P_{it}$, a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the population is larger than the median population in the dataset and 0 otherwise. Using this model, we estimate a 0.75% increase in ridership, which is not statistically significant. Higher average fares negatively affect ridership, while more vehicle hours and miles seem to slightly increase ridership. The results also suggest that more vehicles in service significantly increase ridership, while more vehicle miles slightly decrease it. Again, gas prices do not have a significant effect in this model. Overall, we observe that the majority of the coefficients are very close to 0, with confidence intervals indicating that they could have either a positive or negative overall effect on ridership.
