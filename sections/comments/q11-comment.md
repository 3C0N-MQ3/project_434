In this model, $\beta_1$ is estimated to be 0.0254 with a standard error of 0.0137. The confidence interval for $\beta_1$ is (-0.0015, 0.0523), indicating that the effect of Uber presence ($D_{it}$) on public transit ridership is not statistically significant. This suggests that Uber presence alone does not have a significant impact on ridership.

Additionally, $\beta_2$ is estimated to be -0.0092 with a standard error of 0.0142. The confidence interval for $\beta_2$ is (-0.0371, 0.0187), indicating that the interaction effect of having a population above the median and Uber presence ($P_{it} \times D_{it}$) on public transit ridership is also not statistically significant. This suggests that in areas with a population above the median, Uber presence does not significantly affect ridership.
