In both regressions, LASSO penalized all variables, shrinking their coefficients to zero. This outcome suggests that none of the variables, nor their interactions up to the fifth order, are strong predictors of public transit ridership when considering Uber presence and the interaction terms ($P_{it} \times D_{it}$ and $F_{it} \times D_{it}$). The complexity added by considering high-order interactions among the control variables does not enhance the model's ability to predict public transit ridership.

Given that neither Uber presence nor the high-order interactions of the control variables contribute significantly to the model, we can infer that the direct impact of Uber on public transit ridership, as captured by these models, is minimal. This conclusion aligns with the results from previously estimated, simpler models.
