To account for bias across agencies and within time, we use fixed effects. Using this model, we estimate a 3.54% decrease in ridership, suggesting that Uber substitutes public transit. Higher population estimates are associated with an increase in ridership, in contrast to the previous model, while higher employment levels are linked to an increase. Higher average fares negatively affect ridership, while more vehicle hours and miles significantly increase ridership. The results also suggest that more vehicles in service increase ridership, and, paradoxically, gas prices have a negative but significant effect, unlike in the first OLS model.
